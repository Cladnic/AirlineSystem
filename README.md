# AirlineSystem
A hobby project where I am creating an airline booking system with Java, JavaFx, CSS, and SceneBuilder
I am also using an API to get all the airports in the world for the search function. And an autocomplete functionality when searching for airports.
(In progress)

Preview of Airline booking system:
